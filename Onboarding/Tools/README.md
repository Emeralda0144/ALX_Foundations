## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

### General
* How to navigate in an Unix system

* How to remove a file or directory
* How to move or copy a file or directory

## Requirements
* All tasks must be done inside the sandbox `Ubuntu 20.04`

* Change your working directory to `/root`
* Then, create a directory `school_is_amazing`

**Advices:**
* Don’t forget to validate your current working directory
* Don’t forget to display the list of directories of your current directory to validate the creation of the directory

6. No need

Access your sandbox and:
* Change your working directory to `/root`
